Pokedex Guide Project, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the user interface. 
The website is fully responsive, ensuring optimal viewing across different devices. 
Additionally, I implemented the Fetch API to interact with external data sources, allowing for dynamic content updates without the need to reload the page. 
This integration enhances the overall functionality and user experience of the application.
